# 🛡️ OffSec Architecture

**A visual architecture of offensive security workflows and pentesting methodologies**, mapped through structured Excalidraw diagrams.  
This project helps visualize the **strategic flow of exploitation**, from initial recon to post-exploitation, across various vulnerability classes.

---

## 📐 What is This?

This repository contains curated, modular diagrams built during a real-world internship and self-guided learning.  
It is meant to be a **living roadmap**, updated as new vulnerabilities and testing patterns are learned or revisited.

> 🔄 **Note:** As topics expand, the `monolithic-flow` will grow to reflect all integrated learning in one map.

## 🎯 Goals

- Create **visual learning aids** for pentesting
- Document **real attack logic** based on real-world testing
- Maintain a **growing knowledge base** of offensive security techniques
- Use this during interviews, studies, or actual testing as a reference

---

## 🧠 Why This?

During my internship, I realized I needed a **mental model** and **practical workflow** to connect all the security topics I've been learning.  
These diagrams helped me:

- Understand attack paths better
- Avoid overwhelm
- Retain exploit patterns
- Document what I *actually tested* and how I think

## 📢 Credits

Built by [@am1tt](https://github.com/am1tt) as part of hands-on pentesting practice + internship reflections.

## 📅 Updates

This will be regularly updated as more concepts are learned (SSRF, RCE, path traversal, etc).

Feel free to **star** or **fork** if this helps you study or visualize attack chains.
